# Topological Classifier

For training our topological classifier, we use pretrained weights from [Places365](). The results of CNN can be found in the paper.

We have also experimented with many to one and many to many bidirectional LSTMs to leverage the temperal coherency between the frames and the code has been made available here. The results have not been reported as we didn't observe significant improvement.
